Welcome to the N-Body Simulator!


2D brute force:
contains code for N-body simulations using the Newtonian equations of motion without using an advanced method 


3D brute force:
contains code for N-body simulations using the Newtonian equations of motion without using an advanced method


Octree:
contains code for N-body simulations using the Newtonian equations of motion with use of the Barnes-Hut Algorithm
in the monopole-dipole approximation
Of interest for the user is the main.cpp file:
    -Straightforwardly run this with a initial conditions file at hand;
    -If you don't want the interface, directly go into the code and change the parameter values. You also have to comment out the line of code
    containing "initialiser..."


Octree:
contains code for N-body simulations using the Newtonian equations of motion with use of the Barnes-Hut Algorithm
in the monopole-quadrupole approximation


Initial Condtions:
these files should be of the following structure:

    N
    m x_1 y_1 z_1 vx_1 vy_1 vz_1
    ...
